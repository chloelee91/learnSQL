trim (cl) : deleting all the space
lower (cl) : making it all lower case so that case sensitive does not play a role

**cast -> converting the type
(1) Casting datetimes and timestamps to date type:
CAST(starttime AS date) AS start_date
(2) casting strings to integer
CAST(terminal_name AS int64)  --this casts to integer/int64 is . just gonna be same as integer
(3)example of casting date to string
CAST(install_date AS string)

**String function: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/functions-and-operators#mathematical-functions
length(name) as name_length, -- returns length of the string
  LOWER(name) AS lower_name, -- converts to lower case
  UPPER(name) AS upper_name, -- converts to upper case
  TRIM(name) AS trimmed_name_ex1, -- trims leading and trailing white space,
  TRIM(name,'y') AS trimmed_name_ex2, -- trims leading and trailing white space
  CONCAT(name, ' : ', gender) as concat_ex1, --gluing it together
  CONCAT(name, '-', gender, '-', state) as concat_ex2,
  substr(name,2) as substring_ex1, -- take everything from 2nd position onward
  substr(name,2,3) as substring_ex2, -- starting from second position take  3 characters length,
  substr(name,2,5) as substring_ex3, -- starting from second position take  5 characters length
  substr(name,-3,2) as substring_ex4, --if position is negative, the function counts from the end of value with -1 indicating the last character.
  replace(name,'a','CHRIS') as replace_ex1, --REPLACE(original_value, from_value, to_value)
  
**Date and Time Functions
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS current_time_stamp -- the time that I am running the SQL
DATETIME_ADD(starttime, INTERVAL 5 DAY) AS five_days_later_from_start_time,
DATETIME_DIFF(stoptime, starttime,  MINUTE) as tripduration_minutes,
DATETIME_DIFF(stoptime, starttime,  SECOND) as tripduration_seconds,
DATETIME_DIFF(stoptime, starttime,  HOUR) as tripduration_hours,
date_diff(current_date(), cast(stoptime as date), DAY) as days_from_stop_to_current_date

extract(year from trip_start_timestamp) as year,
extract(day from trip_start_timestamp) as day,
extract(hour from trip_start_timestamp) as hour,
extract(week from trip_start_timestamp) as week
